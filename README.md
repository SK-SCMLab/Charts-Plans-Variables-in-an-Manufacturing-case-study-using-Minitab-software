## ðŸŽ€ Additional control charts
### CuSum charts
- A CuSum chart is a time weighted chart
- CuSum control chart incorportates all the information in a sequence of sample values by plotting the cumulative sums of the deviations of the sample values from the target value
- If Î¼â‚€ -> the target for the process mean
-    xÌ„â±¼ -> the average of the jáµ—Ê° sample

The cumulative sum control chart is formed by plotting the quantity as follows
-                Cáµ¢ = [j=1 to i] Î£ (xÌ„-Î¼â‚€)
- The CuSum chart is ideal for detecting small shifts away from the target and good for monitoring process mean, defectives, defects and variances

### EWMA charts (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Chart)
- It is time weighted control chart
- To plot data to detect small shifts over a small period of time
- To maintain process mean or variance
- Predict performance in next period of change or instability
- More weight on recent observations and less weight on the old observations
**Eg**: Used in Stock Modeling Software Packages
